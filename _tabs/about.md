After almost 10 years in marketing, I have decided it's time for a major career change.

About two or three years ago, I stumbled across the podcast [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com) (if you've never heard of it, I'd highly recommend checking it out!) I started listening to it on my commute to and from work and was instantly hooked. I had never even considered cybersecurity as a career option and knew very little about it.

After a few months of listening to Jack Rhysider's fascinating stories, I started searching out other similar podcast. Not only that, but I started researching things that came up in the stories and trying to teach myself more about them. One day at work, I was working on our website and noticed a bunch of suspicious form submissions and was able to recognize them as SQL injection attempts!

Not long after that I set the goal of changing careers and have been working ever since to make it a reality.

This blog will be a way for me to take notes as I go and share my CTF writeups and other knowledge with others.
