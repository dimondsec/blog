> Shoppy is an easy Linux machine from Hack the Box. Here is the tldr;
>
> * Gobuster scan reveals a `/admin' page, we are able to login with a noSQL injection
> * Once logged in, there is a search bar that is vunerable to the same noSQL injection that reveals two usernames with password hashes.
> * We are able to crack the hash for the user `josh` 
> * After some more enumeration we find the subdomain `mattermost.shoppy.htb` and are able to login with josh's credentials
> * By reading through the message in mattermost, we find credentials to log into a machine called jaeger
> * We're able to ssh into jaeger with the credentials and find a binary for a password manager and we discover credentials for a docker machine called deploy
> * We are able to get root with a basic docker escape from gtfobins.github.io
