{{site.data.alerts.note}}Writeup is an easy Linux machine from Hack the Box. Here is the tldr;

* There is a DoS service blocking most of our automated recon tools, but in robots.txt we find one entry for "/writeup/"
* After some digging we discover the site is built with CMS Made Simple we are able to find an exploit to take advantage of a vulnerability that gives us a username and passwords
* The credentials we found don't let us log in to the CMS, but it does work with SSH

## Enumeration

Let's start of with a quick nmap scan.

```console
$ nmap -v 10.10.10.138
```

![writeup.nmap](writeup.nmap.png)

All we see are ports 22 and 80 open, so let's try opening it in a browser to see what we can find. At the top of the page, we find a warning that the page is protected by some sort of DoS protection script that watches for 40x errors and bans bad IPs, so we'll want to avoid any automated scans so that we don't find ourselves banned.

At the bottom of the page we also see a note that says the page was "hand-crafted with vi." This lets us know that the page likely was coded by hand and most likely wasn't generated by any sort of CMS.

With some luck, I discovered that there is a robots.txt file with one disallowed entry, "/writeup/"

![writeup.robots](writeup.robots.png)

On the /writeup page, we find links to a few unfinished HTB writeups as well as a note at the bottom that the "Pages are hand-crafted with VIM. NOT."  This certainly feels like a hint that this part of the site _IS_ using some kind of CMS, so let's dig in a little bit.

If we view the source code for the page, we can see that it was made using CMS Made Simple, with a copyright date of 2004 - 2019.

![writeup.cms](writeup.cms.png)

I'm not super familiar with CMS Made Simple, but after a quick Google search we're able to find that it is an open source CMS. Not only can we download the source code and run a version on our machine, but we can actually check out the latest version in the Subversion repository through a link of their website (https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/downloads/cmsms).

As I was looking through the files, I discovered a CHANGELOG.txt file in the/doc directory that contains a version number.

![writeup.changelog](writeup.changelog.png)

Will we be lucky enough to find that same file on the writeup page? The answer is yes! In 10.10.10.138/writeup/doc/CHAGELOG.txt we see that this site is running CMS Made Simple version 2.2.9.1.

![writeup.version](writeup.version.png)

Let's look in searchsploit and see if there are any known exploits for this version.

```console
$ searchsploit cms made simple
```

It appears that there is a SQL injection that will likely work for the version running on this box.

## Foothold

Let's create a copy of the script in our current directory.

```console
$ searchsploit -m php/webapps/46635.py
```

If we open up the file in a text editor, we can see that we need to provide it with the URL as an argument. It looks like it is using SQL injection to retreive usernames and password hashes and is even able to crack the passwords. Let's fire it up and see what happens.

The script is written in python 2, so I set up a quick python virtual environment to run it in.

```console
$ virtualenv writeup

$ source writeup/bin/activate
```

Then run the script with the URL and specify a wordlist so that it will crack the hash for us. You could run it with only the url and then use hashcat to crack the hash if you would like, but since it's an option I ran with it.  **Make sure to use the url for the writeup page, or you will trigger the DoS protection script and be banned for a little bit.**

```console
(writeup) $ python 46635.py --url http://10.10.10.138/writeup --crack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

It's a little slow, but after a few minutes we'll see that it found a username and password hash/salt and that it was successfully able to crack it.

## User

While looking through the files earlier I discovered a login page at /writeup/admin (you could also discover this with something like gobuster), but the credentials we found didn't work. Let's try logging in with ssh.

```console
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/writeup]
└─$ ssh jkr@10.10.10.138             
jkr@10.10.10.138's password:

jkr@writeup:~$ 
```

Success!!

We're in, and right away are able to find the user flag.
